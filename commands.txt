** Go to system directory
adb shell
cd sys

**Go to system app directory, where all application apk files are stored.We have to craete another directory in this directory. This directory name is as same as the apk name. Then we put apk file in this new directory

cd system/app

** See the all file list with permission
ls -al

*Test
cd KeyChain/
ls

** Go to the previous directory
cd ../

** Now I make a directory for my application with the same name apk and directory
mkdir LocalMedia/

**If there is warning "Read-only file only" then we need to run below commands
su

** If su not working then run below command
adb root
adb remount 

mkdir Local/ (create Local directory)
cd Local/ (Go to this directory)
cd ../ (Go back to the previous directory)
rm -rf Local/ (Remove Local Directory)

mkdir LocalMedia/

*Exit from this process
exit

*Now push my biuld apk file to the system 
adb push "D:\Android Projects\TvBrowser\MediaMstar\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\LocalMedia.apk" /system/app/LocalMedia/

** if there will warning like "remote fchown failed: Operation not permitted"
adb root
adb remount

then again try to push and run previous push command

** now check
adb shell
cd sys
cd system/app/LocalMedia/
ls

** check apk file permission 
ls -al LocalMedia.apk
